# JavaScript-multiple-choice-quiz

## Description
I was given the task of producing a quiz game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I was able to get the quiz game to be somewhat functional. We were asked to implement a timer when the user started the quiz but my timer was buggy. When the game ended it kept displaying two diffetent timer counts so when the quiz ended the timer restarted but the old timer count was still running. 
The game also required a user to submit their score so it would be saved onto the local storage but when I tried to implement the feature, the game itself stopped fuctioning correctly.
